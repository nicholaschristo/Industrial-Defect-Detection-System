## Overview

This project implements a real-time industrial machine vision inspection system using OpenCV for automated defect detection and quality inspection.

The system captures live video from a USB camera, analyzes components within a predefined Region of Interest (ROI), and determines whether a part is GOOD or DEFECTIVE based on geometric measurements and inspection rules.

The project simulates quality control applications commonly used in manufacturing, assembly verification, machine vision inspection stations, and Industry 4.0 environments.

# Inspection Parameters

The system evaluates each detected component using:

### Area Inspection

The contour area of the detected object is measured and compared against predefined tolerance limits.

### Aspect Ratio Inspection

The ratio between object dimensions is calculated and used to verify shape consistency.

### Orientation Inspection

Objects are classified as:

- Horizontal
- Vertical
- Tilted

Tilted components can be identified and rejected.

---

# Defect Detection Logic

The system classifies parts using multiple inspection criteria.
## Master Capture

![Master Capture](master_capture_1.png)
### GOOD Part

A part is classified as GOOD when:

- Object is present
- Area is within tolerance
- Aspect ratio is within tolerance
- Orientation is acceptable

### DEFECTIVE Part

A part is classified as DEFECTIVE when:

- Area exceeds tolerance limits
- Shape dimensions are incorrect
- Orientation is invalid
- Geometric characteristics deviate from expected values
